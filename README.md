# An appication I use for time management
A Pomodoro game is likely a variation of the traditional Pomodoro Technique, a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as "Pomodoros."

In the context of a Pomodoro game, the concept of the Pomodoro Technique may be gamified to make the process of focused work and breaks more engaging and enjoyable
